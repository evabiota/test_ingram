# I used Bootstrap 4, to optimize the time and adding predefined classes for margins paddings and flex box that allow me go faster and write less styles and media queries

# I used sass for the styles compiled with a gulpfile.js
# Didn't add any js because I only focussed in the right layout and the responsiviness of it.
